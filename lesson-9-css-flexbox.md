## What problem does flexbox solve?

In CSS, it is notoriously difficult to center things. Because a lot of the old tactics used are no longer relevant in the modern web, we aren't going to be learning them. But just keep in mind that learning CSS flexbox layout solves a huge problem that gave many folks many headaches. So treasure it!
