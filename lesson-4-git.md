## What _is_ Git? 

#### Git is what we use to save changes and versions of our code. 

It is also the **_vehicle_** for us to navigate through our codes __history__ and __incarnations__.

> Git is a piece of software, it just happens to be text-based and doesn't have a GUI. (graphical user interface)

## And GitHub?

_So then what is GitHub? The same thing?_

Not quite... Git is the _system_, and GitHub is a website that _uses_ git to help us host our code online. It also provides a pretty UI for us to use to interact with Git.

_Again, Git is a system, like the rules of a word tile game is a system._

GitHub is a __wrapper__ built around the __system__ of Git. Similar to how Words with Friends is a __wrapper__ built around the __system__ of word tile games.

> _If you're halfway through a Scrabble game and knock the table over, you've lost everything, the system can't save you from that. __But__ if you lose your phone halfway through a Words with Friends game, you can simply login online and keep playing._

## Examples and Usage

Alright, let's dive into it!

![rick and morty returned from an underwater adventure](https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F56768%252Faffb5be6-2255-47d8-94af-5a682cabc59a.png%252F950x534.png?signature=GgXW8YgT1m8IWKG8ePj8FLahfwA=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com)

##### Here are some beginner git commands you'll need: 
> _(everything in `<brackets>` are just placeholder examples)_

* `git init` - "Initialize" git in this folder (prep folder for use with Git).

> 

* `git add <file>` - Tell Git that a certain folder or file should be "tracked" (you're planning on sending it up to GitHub)

> 

* `git commit` - Bundle together everything being "tracked" by Git and take a snapshot of the bundled code at this exact point in time. 

> 

* `git push` - Send your "bundle" of code up to GitHub to be stored on the web.

Additional basic commands you'll need to use:

* `git clone <url_of_some_code>` - Downloads a copy of a specified programming project on the internet.

> 

* `git pull` - "Refreshes" your project with any new changes that have been made. (Pulls those changes down from the internet repository)

> 

* `git status` - Gives you information about your files relation to git. (have they been added, committed, or neither?)

>

* `git checkout -b <new_branch_name>` - Copies the state of the project over to a new space (branch) where you can make changes without affecting the original copy you "pulled" down.

> 

* `git checkout <existing_branch_name>` - Allows you to "switch" over to other branches that were created and see what that code looks like in those "alternate universes"

> _Now let's put some of those into practice!_
