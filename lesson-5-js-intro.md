# What is JS

![Slide of death star frame, death star lights on, kyber ray]()

When we talked about the three pillars of the web, we talked about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML gives our web pages __structure__, CSS gives our web pages __style__, and Javascript give our webpages __functionality__. With all three of these tools in your arsenal, there is no limit to what you can build on the web.

JavaScript is what you'll hear referred to as a _programming language_. HTML and CSS are also languages, but they are for _markup_ and _style_ respectively. 

_JavaScript is a completely different programming language from _Java_. This is good to keep in mind as you're googling JS issues while developing._

_JS connects to our webpage similar to how a CSS file would, by connecting to the __HTML__._

# Do websites need JavaScript?

Every time you fill out a form, search for something, login, load an account, or really do anything other than just look at _static_ content on the web, you are leveraging the power of JavaScript. A website without JavaScript would never change. It's contents would be set in stone, simply displaying information with nothing the user could do to interact with it.

When we talk about _static_ vs _dynamic_ websites, you can think of them like cars. Imagine having a badass Delorian with leather seats and intricate details, but no engine. You can sit in it and enjoy it for a while, but that's gonna get old quick. Now let's say that Delorian has an engine _and_ a flux capacitor. RAD. __That's__ the kind of difference JS can bring by allowing us to build dynamic sites.

# Am I cut out to be a programmer?

![goofy 80's style guy at a computer with the title "Hackerman" underneath him]()

People often assume that because they aren't "good" at math, or don't consider themselves to be left-brained, they could never become programmers or engineers. __This is one of the biggest misconceptions about programming__. 

Can those things _help_? Sure! Are they _fundamental_? Absolutely not. 

Becoming a programmer is about learning a new way of thinking. It's about approaching problems differently, and being able to break them down. It's __not__ about memorizing syntax and being a human calculator. You will naturally start remembering things more and more as time passes and you spend time using these tools and working in the JavaScript programming language. But what is most valuable is developing the skill set of _thinking like a developer_. 

### TL;DR - You _are_ without a doubt cut out to be a programmer. Your own journey will be unique, but the web is for you. Everything you bring to the table is valuable.

![goofy picture of people encouraging each other]()

The web is a blank canvas. Any idea you've ever had for a game, an art project, an app, _literally anything_, JavaScript is the superpower that will enable you to make these things a reality.

# Getting Started

![Parody of "Hello World" code, or unsplash code]()

* Dive in and follow along with an example
* alert with a string "hello world"
* Console log 2 + 2 or some math
* browser and the console

### Where and how
How does the browser know where our JavaScript is? And How does it know what to do with it?
* Browser requests the html file, html tells browser where CSS is. HTMl also tells the browser where the JS is.
* The JS is _run_ by the browser.
  * What running code means high level 

### Values
* How data is represented
* Numbers
* Strings (text)
* Types? Primitives?

### Variables
* var, let, const differences
* declaration and variable assignment

### The Console
* console.log
* see our variables spit out

### Variable assignment
* equal sign does not mean equal
* assign another variable to a previous one

### Functions
* Arguments
* Parameters
* logic
* return value
* using vars in functions
  * Like ingredients.
  * var and let are open containers
  * const has the lid glued on
* logic with simple addition/subtraction
* calling/invoking/defining

### Math
* Wait I thought you said no math

Alright, _technically_ they're called...

### Operators
* Add
* Subtract
* Multiply
* Divide

### Concatenation
* Strings and string manipulation
* Alert hello someone's name (funnier)

### Comments
* pseudo code

### DOM preview
* next week looking at the DOM
* Visualize changes on the webpage by manipulating the DOM with JS
