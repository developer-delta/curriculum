#  Objects

In Javascript, sometimes we need to store a more complex set of information than an array will allow for. Whenever this need arises, it's time to reach for an `Object`.
  
`Objects` organize collections in a way that allows for easy retrieval and grouping. Objects are created by using curly braces `{}`.
  
```javascript
let benny = {};
```
  
Here we have defined a variable `benny`, and assigned it to an empty `Object`. Go ahead and create a new JS file, Chrome snippet, or Codepen if you'd like to follow along!
  
##  When Objects are needed
  
  
Objects will come in handy if you are trying to group and relate multiple pieces of information together.
  
_Let's say that you're building an online LEGO Minifigure builder, and you want the user to be able to choose different colors and pieces._
  
* obj example with three or so properties. head, body, helmet(boolean)
  
* console.log the whole obj

##  Object Properties
  
  
* what is a property? (methods later)
  
* "key: value" pairs (semicolon syntax)
  
###  Adding Properties
  
  
* dot notation (you used this before)
  
* getter and setter with/w/o assignment operator
  
* what type of data can live in an object
  
###  Retrieving Properties
  
  
* getter
  
* bracket notation too for dashes or weird names
  
##  Methods
  
  
* properties vs methods
  
* directly add a method
  
* add a method after the fact (?)
  
* calling and logging
  
  
  
##  This
  
  
* what is this, how to use. Do a function that alerts or something
  
##  Nesting Objects
  
  
* sometimes called `sub-namespaces`
  
* drill down chaining dot notation to access deep objs
  
##  Objects are everywhere
  
  
* quick note on how basically everything is an object
  
* how document. and Math. and all that jazz are methods on objects (Classes but don't get too in the weeds)
  
* Maybe a little preview of browser API's that we've already used
